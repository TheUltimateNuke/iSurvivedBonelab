# iSurvivedBonelab
## Description
BLSurvival or iSurvivedBonelab is a WIP modification for BoneLab utilizing MelonLoader (PC only). The goal of this mod is to allow modders to incorporate traditional survival elements into their levels and spawnables, while also giving the user the choice to configure everything and opt in/out at any point.  

## Requirements
- BoneLab
- [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/)
- [BoneLib](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/gnonme/BoneLib/)

## Features
### Complete
- Completely configurable in BoneMenu (Don't edit MelonPreferences)
- HUD, follows hand of choice

### To-Do
- Hunger system with support for modders to add custom food spawnables.
- Thirst system with support for modders to add custom drink spawnables.
- Disease system with support for modders to add custom diseases, causes, and effects.
- Temperature system with support for level creators to add trigger-based temperature volumes.
- Crafting system with support for custom recipes, workbenches, and resources.
- Periodic wave-based enemy spawning on maps that support it, to simulate Minecraft's night mob system. (toggleable by user ofc)
- Random spawning of food, water, guns, ammo, etc. with support for modders to add custom random spawn points.
- Optional sample level showing off all major features
- Backpack spawnable with an array of holsters for storing things.
- Sanity system (killing neutral/passive npcs and standing in the dark for too long reduces it)
